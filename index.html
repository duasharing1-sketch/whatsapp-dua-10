This powerful dua asks Allah ﷻ — Al-Wadud, (The Most Loving) — to grant us His pure, boundless, and special love. The kind of love that surrounds the heart, transforms the soul, and uplifts every part of our being.

Because when Allah loves you, nothing else compares.

“Allah said: My servant continues to draw near to Me with voluntary deeds until I love him…" — Hadith Qudsi (Bukhari)

*Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Wadud (O Most Loving), grant us Your immense and special love, and pour it within our hearts and entire being. Surround us with it, encompass and envelop us with it, dress us with it, let its beautiful scent emanate strongly from us, and grant it to us without limit.*

This du'a is part of *The Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a powerful collection of heartfelt supplications designed to benefit you in both this life and the next. 

*At Dua Sharing, our mission is simple*: 

To encourage sincere dua, meaningful sharing, and to multiply blessings through a growing global chain of people making dua for one another every single day.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said: 

“The supplication of a Muslim for his brother in his absence will certainly be answered. Every time he makes a supplication for good for his brother, the angel appointed for this task says: ‘Ameen! And may it be for you too.”

Every post we share is taken directly from the full Supplication of Infinite Blessings — with the aim of moving hearts, inspiring action, and reminding us all of what truly matters.

When you share this post, you’re not simply sharing a dua. You’re opening the door to millions of people making sincere dua for you — with the Malaika (Angels) themselves saying “Ameen” to every single one.

May Allah accept it from you, and from everyone it reaches through you.

Ameen`;
